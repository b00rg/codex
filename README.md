## Codex: A Collaborative Note-Taking App
Codex is a secure, decentralized note-taking application that leverages Markdown for formatting and version control for tracking changes. It enables users to take notes locally and share them using IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for enhanced privacy and collaboration.

> Note: This repository is a work in progress.

Unlike traditional cloud-based note-taking apps, which may compromise user anonymity, Codex ensures secure and private file sharing. By utilizing IPFS, the notes are stored across multiple contributors' local systems rather than on centralized servers. This decentralized approach enhances security and privacy for all users. Additionally, with version control, Codex allows users to safeguard their notes from unwanted changes, providing a more reliable and transparent collaborative experience than other popular apps.
